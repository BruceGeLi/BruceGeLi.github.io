I am a Ph.D. candidate at
the [Autonomous Learning Robots](https://alr.iar.kit.edu/) (ALR) Lab of
the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english/), under
the supervision of Prof. Gerhard
Neumann. [Prof. Gerhard Neumann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=GL360kMAAAAJ&hl=en).
In addition, I collaborate closely
with [T.T. Prof. Rudolf Lioutikov](https://rudolf.intuitive-robots.net/).
<br>

My research primarily concentrates on advancing the learning and representation
of robotic movement trajectories, with a particular emphasis on their
application in tasks involving robot imitation and reinforcement learning. I
hold the conviction that robots possess the potential to learn and emulate human
behavior, enabling them to observe their surroundings and execute movements in
an intuitive fashion. This intuition encompasses movements that are both smooth
and consistent. In pursuit of these objectives, I am committed to enhancing the
capacity of models, their learning efficiency, and their ability to provide
explanations, all through the adoption of state-of-the-art algorithms and tools.

I was born and raised in Beijing, China and obtained my Bachelor's degree in
Mechanical Engineering at
the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China).
Subsequently, I moved to Germany and obtained my Master's degree in
Computer-Aided
Mechanical Engineering at
the [RWTH Aachen University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWTH_Aachen_University).
During this period, my interests shifted towards Robotics and Computer Science.
leading me to undertake an internship at
[KÃ¤rcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4rcher).
Later, I joined
the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/)
(MPIIS) for my Master's thesis, where I met my thesis
advisor [Prof. Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters)
and my current Ph.D.
advisor [Prof. Gerhard Neumann](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=GL360kMAAAAJ&hl=en).
